Which is also kinda symbolic for Ebooks.SE in general.&#xA;I try to through the review queues on a regular basis. But I don't see a lot of other people going through them. So often my reviews are probably not even helpful at all as they never conclude with enough supporting reviews." CreationDate="2020-07-24T11:54:13.453" UserId="1202" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
