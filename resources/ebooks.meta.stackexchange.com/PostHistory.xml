A random example of such a question is “http://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/160/is-there-online-ebook-authoring-tool-which-can-produce-epub-and-pdf-formats”. To me, this is as much a &quot;shopping list&quot; question as my question is, resulting in similar link recommendation replies as my question does. In fact, the example question even goes beyond that, as it asks for &quot;product recommendations&quot;, which is more &quot;shopping-list&quot; than my question. At least from my point of view.

What can I do? **Abbreviated answer:** Using the menu commands in Document Viewer, we see that the document specifies a font that is neither embedded in the document nor included in the default install of your software. By creating certain definitions in file $HOME/.config/fontsconfig/fonts.conf you can enable your software to substitute a certain font with comparable metrics that is indeed included.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example:** How can I display PDFs sideways on my Linux laptop so I can hold the machine like a book and the display will fit a page shape better. **Abbreviated answer:**  Your best method will depend on further details of your hardware and software.

Nobody (at least not today) is making their decisions about which format to publish or consume based on virus vulnerabilities.

Fundamentally, spam tries to sell you something when you didn't ask for anything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some spam is after your money. Sometimes it's indirect, such as spam that wants you to visit a website and click on the ads. Some spam wants you to visit a website with malware that may be able to infect your computer. Sometimes spam is after things other than money; political spam is still spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes you'll see posts from broken spam bots that only have the framing but are missing a reference to the brand or site being advertised. Treat them as spam. Stack Exchange has some technical measures designed to limit spam, so the proportion of spams from bot tests rather than from working bots is quite high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some things, however, are not spam:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Wildly off-topic questions are not spam. Vote to close, perhaps flag as low quality, but do not flag them as spam.&#xD;&#xA; * Nonsense posts that aren't clearly the product of a bot are not spam. Flag as low quality or “not an answer”, possibly downvote (and vote to delete if you have that privilege).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## I saw a spam post, what should I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flag as spam**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flagging as spam is the most effective way of dealing with spam. A post that receives 6 spam flags is automatically deleted and locked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't raise a custom flag, select the “it is spam” predefined reason. That gives extra work to moderators as they need to handle the custom flag separately. Moderators see spam flags, and generally react to them by destroying the account.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Don't bother downvoting spam**. It's actually counterproductive for questions as they are taken off the front page if their score drops below -4. A spam flag already reduces the post's score by 1. (But don't upvote either: we don't want to risk giving the spammer privileges, or to say to the quality control system that there is something worth saving on that account.) There's also no need to vote to close a spam question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't edit the post to blank out the spam, except for when the post contains p*rn. This makes it harder for others to notice that the post is spam and must be removed pronto. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## I saw a spam edit, what should I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most spammers post questions or answers but some try to sneak in spam via edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reject spam edits, or edits that are testing bots, as vandalism. There is currently no separate tracking for spam and other kinds of vandalism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pay attention to edits that add links — most are helpful (adding a link to a paper or to Wikipedia), but occasionally the link is to a spam or phishing or malware site, so check the targets of links when you review suggested edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How can I help fight spam most effectively?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flag as spam** and move on. Really, that's the most helpful thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is one other thing: if other people with a Stack Exchange account are around (in real life, or in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/)), you might ask them to flag as well, especially in the slow hours when there are few people around on the site. This is highly effective if you happen to participate or visit any highly active chatrooms. Anyone with 15 reputation can flag. If you have 200 reputation on one Stack Exchange site, you get an association bonus which is sufficient to raise flags on any site (if you've never interacted with that site before, you'll need to create an account on that site by clicking the “login” button).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to [Gilles on CS Meta](http://meta.cs.stackexchange.com/q/686/2044).&lt;/sub&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I've read all your points, and they are all valid ones. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I opened that Q&amp;A, I was doing it in response to my own suggestion [here][1]. Being it something like a &quot;bait&quot; question, something that I figured could be one of the things that has a great chance to be asked anyway eventually, I opened it with the purpose of being phrased in a generic way; If someone is going to arrive here from a search engine, is more likely that he will use simplier and more general terms like &quot;optimize epub&quot; rather than &quot;improving epub loading times&quot;; hence my choice of words. As Jason Down has already noted on this question, I took care to make explicit in the body of the question what I was asking in a more generic way in the title, which IMHO should be descriptive but also catch attention in a brief and effective way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I agree that asking for tips and trick in the subsequent comment was clearly against the rules, so here is what I propose:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - deleting my comment where I ask for T&amp;T.&#xD;&#xA;  - if someone has some ideas on how to improve my question, without changing its meaning and its clear and simple scope, of course is free to do that.&#xD;&#xA;  - as a last resort, it can be splitted in multiple questions, but I think that this way it will lose part of its purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.ebooks.stackexchange.com/q/76/136" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The reason is because that is an Ebook specific issue that can be addressed actively where the other question is a general threat that is not specific to EBooks other than you arbitrarily  decided to limit the scope to Ebooks. But the question and answers do not change when you change the scope to some other arbitrary choice.  " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So, there has to be something I am not understanding correctly in relation to that badge. But what am I missing?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Currently, I see two possible options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. According to the description, a good chunk of the members here should have received the badge, but they didn't… which would point to a bug in the system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The alternative is that the current “public beta” is still regarded to be a *private* beta by the system and the description is wrong. In that case, someone should probably update that description. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  The badges are manually awarded by the staff at SE, and we went to public beta during a holiday week.

I think the question of scope here is really a question of who the audience of this site is meant to be: creators and distributors of ebooks, or readers of ebooks? It seems like other Stack Exchange sites divide these groups up: Stack Overflow is for people creating programs, and Super User is for people using them. Similarly, [Arqade][1] is for people who play games, while [Game Development][2] is for people who make them. We don't have the activity to justify splitting into two different sites, of course, but I believe that keeping these two audiences in mind is the key to determining if a question is in scope or not. Questions and their answers should serve one or the other of those audiences&amp;mdash;they should solve problems that content creators and publishers have, or they should solve problems that ebook readers have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've always thought that solving problems is what the Stack Exchange sites are all about&amp;mdash;that's why experts congregate here. [Questions that don't address a particular problem][3] seem out of place, regardless of how interesting they are&amp;mdash;they seem more devoted to a discussion board, because they're of the &quot;[I would like to participate in a discussion about _______________][4]&quot; type.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for why those questions would be out of scope for Stack Overflow: while many questions about ebook creation are HTML/CSS quetsions at their root, there are a lot of quirks to the various ebook reading systems that are unique to those systems&amp;mdash;answers from web designer might not work in an ebook.

My suggestion would be that we pick a Creative Commons (or other open licensed) book to go over. Rather than doing full critiques, we post the issues we find as questions. We can then link to the relevant book, and have no worries about duplicating code or content in posts because of the open licenses.

For those who are not familiar, here's a summary (courtesy of Jon Ericson):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Most of you probably remember previous years’ events, but I’ll recap&#xD;&#xA;&gt; anyway, for the newbies among us. Winter Bash is an annual event that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earn “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (analogous&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to badges). Certain actions trigger the user receiving a hat, which&#xD;&#xA;&gt; their gravatar can “wear”. We track everyone’s progress earning hats&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in a leaderboard that looks something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Winter Bash 2014 will again be available to all sites that choose to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; participate. We’re redesigning all the hats and adding some extra&#xD;&#xA;&gt; features to keep things fresh and exciting.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Some Details**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This event will run from 15 December 2014 to 4 January 2015. Users&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will be able to see their entire hat collection on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [winterbash2014.stackexchange.com](http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com). That site will also have a landing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option&#xD;&#xA;&gt; available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will go back into storage. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;This is a fun event, so I personally recommend that we participate. Please chime in in the answers with your own feelings on the topic. Unless there is a strong anti-hat vibe out there in the ebook world, we will be bustin' out all sorts of weird headgear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/pl9TB.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is&#xD;&#xA;apparently starting slowly, and I have been trying to contribute to&#xD;&#xA;its attractiveness, with whatever knowledge and time I have, since I&#xD;&#xA;think ebooks are a very important topic, technically and culturally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contributing takes time, as I know from doing it on other sites. It&#xD;&#xA;also takes many forms. We are suppose to use this site keeping in mind&#xD;&#xA;that questions are never only for the asker, but are to be an&#xD;&#xA;available resource, together with answers, for future users interested&#xD;&#xA;by the issue. Hence it is important that questions be clear and&#xD;&#xA;informative. This is why questions are supposed to show some research&#xD;&#xA;effort, and to contribute whatever knowledge the asker has already&#xD;&#xA;gathered on the issue. It helps future users, and it helps focus&#xD;&#xA;answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthemore, it is always hard to know whether a missing or apparently&#xD;&#xA;inconsistent information in the question is due to ignorance by the&#xD;&#xA;asker, or carelessness on his part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course the same holds for answers. Answers are not always complete&#xD;&#xA;answers, but are supposed at least to contribute data to a partial&#xD;&#xA;answer. Partial answers are particularly fair when a question has&#xD;&#xA;remained totally unanswered  for 6 months, and when the comments&#xD;&#xA;indicate that it is not even clear to some users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is precisely the case for question&#xD;&#xA;http://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/6058/how-to-automatically-hyphenate-before-sending-to-a-device/6413?noredirect=1#comment3752_6413. And&#xD;&#xA;the 7 comments are evidence to its lack of clarity. The OP&#xD;&#xA;takes as an excuse the fact that English is not his native language,&#xD;&#xA;but he clearly masters it well enough (BTW, it is not my native&#xD;&#xA;language either).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The OP asked a very terse question, that was not even well phrased. He&#xD;&#xA;did not show any research, and even withheld what information he had&#xD;&#xA;on the topic, as proved by his later comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being interested in the issue, I did some search on my own. In my&#xD;&#xA;answer I provided more explanation that should have been in the&#xD;&#xA;question (but I thought it would be editing it too much), and that the&#xD;&#xA;OP had not bothered giving despite obvious misunderstanding and&#xD;&#xA;explicit requests in comments (but it was not clear at that point that&#xD;&#xA;he knew that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also gave a reference to a tool that did at least part of what he&#xD;&#xA;wanted. He also knew about that tool, but gave no hint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally he criticized my answer in a comment, which is fair&#xD;&#xA;enough. However I told him that his question was not up to standard,&#xD;&#xA;and that my answer was a consequence of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So he concluded with a rude comment, and downvoted my answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally never downvote, because I think it is useless in all non&#xD;&#xA;obvious cases, and often unfair. And obvious cases are ... obvious,&#xD;&#xA;and probably better handled by flags. I believe in discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think the behavior of users like the OP of the question I&#xD;&#xA;am discussing is detrimental to the site. He contributes nothing and&#xD;&#xA;discourages arrogantly those who try to contribute.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

They're annoying, but they are part of life, and they're part of the peril of participating in a site where the person asking the question may not understand the issues (see the [XY problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/238426)). After all, someone's always [wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's nothing here to do but move on and not take it personally. After all, as of right now, you have a net +1 score on that answer (worth a net +18 reputation). The -2 reputation just isn't a big deal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should be aware, however, that your comment exchange on your answer probably didn't help you. I've cleaned up the comments because some of them weren't constructive, but one of your comments was this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The point is that you are supposed to write clear questions, and give context. You did not. You may consider that I did not answer you: your priviledge [sic]. The point is that you do not respect the intention of this site which is to constitute a collection of good questions with good answer that can help many people. Your question is bad, because it is too terse to be fully clear (not just my opinion) and does not give the context you already know. English is not the native language of many users, but this is not the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That comes across as a lecture at best and an ad hominem insult at worst. It does not come across as constructive criticism. In the future, you may want to remember that getting into sharp discussions with people and questioning their sincerity or motives is not likely to provoke a good response. It certainly boosts the odds of a downvote, fair or unfair, in the context of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not technically part of the answer to your question, but it's still relevant to the reasoning behind your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing jumped out at me about your post. You wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;I personally never downvote, because I think it is useless in all non obvious cases, and often unfair. And obvious cases are ... obvious, and probably better handled by flags. I believe in discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You *should* downvote when appropriate.

Downvotes are critical to the way Stack Exchange sites like this one work: we rely on upvotes to move good content up *and downvotes to move bad content down*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Note: I am not saying you should or should not have downvoted the question at issue, and I'm not weighing in on whether or not the OP's vote against your question was justified, assuming it really was the OP who cast the downvote.*&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

A question about MS Word docs or PDFs is not necessarily a question about ebooks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if a user is having problems with basic Word formatting, creating a PDF form, or similar issues, those topics are not good material for this site. Likewise, how to layout a greeting card, create an infographic, or format a letter in one of these file formats would be off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By contrast, how to format different headings in Word for material that is supposed to be read, rather than viewed, is entirely on-topic. So is creation of internal and external links, font selection, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The critical question is: what type of material are we producing? Is it an ebook, that is, a document that is intended to be read on an electronic device of some sort? Or is it something else, something that is purely graphical or intended for consumption in print?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that a question may be on-topic on more than one SE site. It can be on-topic at Super User, for example, without being off-topic here. But a question is probably *best* on one particular site. So, for example, a question about writing VBA routines to automate aspects of ebook creation in Word *might* be on-topic here, but it's probably a better fit for Stack Overflow. A question about file conversion with pandoc to produce consistent output in PDF, .epub, and .mobi formats *might* be on-topic at Super User, but it's probably better here."

If you were, say, asking about covers that match your current reader, that would get much spammier answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question is still off-topic, though, because it's about accessories for particular physical devices used to read ebooks, not about ebooks per se. In other words, the question is basically, &quot;What Kobo models are the same size as a Kobo Glo, so that a cover designed for Model *X* will work on my Kobo Glo?&quot; That's pretty far from being about ebooks themselves. On top of that, the answers would rapidly become outdated as the Kobo model lineup changes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of that said, we've been seeing more and more questions about devices lately, and we've been pretty tolerant of hardware-related questions ever since [our first Meta question][1].

Just spit-balling here, and I'm not super-familiar with Kobo products, but if I'm looking at the right info on Kobo's site, the Kobo Glo is 157 x 114 x 10 mm, and the Kobo Glo HD is 157 x 115 x 9.2 mm. That's only a 1 mm difference in width and 0.8 mm in thickness, which implies the HD case might well work on your older model, depending on exactly how the case attaches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1/hardware-questions" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Fundamentally, spam tries to sell you something when you didn't ask for anything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some spam is after your money. Sometimes it's indirect, such as spam that wants you to visit a website and click on the ads. Some spam wants you to visit a website with malware that may be able to infect your computer. Sometimes spam is after things other than money; political spam is still spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes you'll see posts from broken spam bots that only have the framing but are missing a reference to the brand or site being advertised. Treat them as spam. Stack Exchange has some technical measures designed to limit spam, so the proportion of spams from bot tests rather than from working bots is quite high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some things, however, are not spam:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Wildly off-topic questions are not spam. Vote to close, perhaps flag as low quality, but do not flag them as spam.&#xD;&#xA; * Nonsense posts that aren't clearly the product of a bot are not spam. Flag as low quality or “not an answer”, possibly downvote (and vote to delete if you have that privilege).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## I saw a spam post, what should I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flag as spam**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flagging as spam is the most effective way of dealing with spam. A post that receives 6 spam flags is automatically deleted and locked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't raise a custom flag, select the “it is spam” predefined reason. That gives extra work to moderators as they need to handle the custom flag separately. Moderators see spam flags, and generally react to them by destroying the account.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Don't bother downvoting spam**. It's actually counterproductive for questions as they are taken off the front page if their score drops below -4. A spam flag already reduces the post's score by 1. (But don't upvote either: we don't want to risk giving the spammer privileges, or to say to the quality control system that there is something worth saving on that account.) There's also no need to vote to close a spam question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't edit the post to blank out the spam, except for when the post contains p*rn. This makes it harder for others to notice that the post is spam and must be removed pronto. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## I saw a spam edit, what should I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most spammers post questions or answers but some try to sneak in spam via edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reject spam edits, or edits that are testing bots, as vandalism. There is currently no separate tracking for spam and other kinds of vandalism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pay attention to edits that add links — most are helpful (adding a link to a paper or to Wikipedia), but occasionally the link is to a spam or phishing or malware site, so check the targets of links when you review suggested edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How can I help fight spam most effectively?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flag as spam** and move on. Really, that's the most helpful thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is one other thing: if other people with a Stack Exchange account are around (in real life, or in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/)), you might ask them to flag as well, especially in the slow hours when there are few people around on the site. This is highly effective if you happen to participate or visit any highly active chatrooms. Anyone with 15 reputation can flag. If you have 200 reputation on one Stack Exchange site, you get an association bonus which is sufficient to raise flags on any site (if you've never interacted with that site before, you'll need to create an account on that site by clicking the “login” button).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to [Gilles on CS Meta](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/686/2044).&lt;/sub&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I think the question of scope here is really a question of who the audience of this site is meant to be: creators and distributors of ebooks, or readers of ebooks?

A random example of such a question is “https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/160/is-there-online-ebook-authoring-tool-which-can-produce-epub-and-pdf-formats”. To me, this is as much a &quot;shopping list&quot; question as my question is, resulting in similar link recommendation replies as my question does. In fact, the example question even goes beyond that, as it asks for &quot;product recommendations&quot;, which is more &quot;shopping-list&quot; than my question. At least from my point of view. And to be sure no one thinks my example wasn't random enough, let me point to another random example which results in similar &quot;product recommendation&quot; answers: “https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/9/clean-up-converted-ebook”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Letting the eBook community decide…**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oh well, may the moderators and the community decide what to do with my question. Personally, I won't be angry if it stays live (I mean, there was a reason for me to post it in the first place). But the world won't fall apart for me if the community decides it is best to delete my question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See, in cases like these, I tend to go with the flow and comply with the general consensus for the benefit of the community. If you think it should stay, feel free to ignore my deletion-request flag. And if you think it should be killed, be my guest. It's up to you, dear ebook community. Whatever you decide, you got my humble *“OK”* on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The need to draw lines…**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, I would like to advise that we — as a community — make sure we don't flag questions before having set up exact parameters of what is allowed and what not. Anything else would be wrong, because it would be non-constructive for both Ebooks.SE as well as it's current and future members.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have edited [my question](https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/188/some-classic-literature-is-available-for-free-but-where) in the hope it now is more well defined and more specific/detailed. Though, I could not modify it in a way that it would not attract references and links. On the other hand, I added an example link which should make clear what the question is asking for… alike quality references." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I think the question of scope here is really a question of who the audience of this site is meant to be: creators and distributors of ebooks, or readers of ebooks? It seems like other Stack Exchange sites divide these groups up: Stack Overflow is for people creating programs, and Super User is for people using them. Similarly, [Arqade][1] is for people who play games, while [Game Development][2] is for people who make them. We don't have the activity to justify splitting into two different sites, of course, but I believe that keeping these two audiences in mind is the key to determining if a question is in scope or not. Questions and their answers should serve one or the other of those audiences&amp;mdash;they should solve problems that content creators and publishers have, or they should solve problems that ebook readers have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've always thought that solving problems is what the Stack Exchange sites are all about&amp;mdash;that's why experts congregate here. [Questions that don't address a particular problem][3] seem out of place, regardless of how interesting they are&amp;mdash;they seem more devoted to a discussion board, because they're of the &quot;[I would like to participate in a discussion about _______________][4]&quot; type.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for why those questions would be out of scope for Stack Overflow: while many questions about ebook creation are HTML/CSS quetsions at their root, there are a lot of quirks to the various ebook reading systems that are unique to those systems&amp;mdash;answers from web designer might not work in an ebook.

But it's pretty likely that I'd just stop at the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats) in the same search results. Still, when I search for [`DjVu useful`](https://www.google.com/webhp#q=DjVu+useful), it's the top result. And the answer looks fine. **Satisfactory**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1256/are-back-of-the-book-indexes-useful**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My search turned up [Missing Entry: Whither the eBook Index?](http://newkindofbook.com/2011/09/missing-entry-whither-the-ebook-index/) That's a pretty high bar to clear and this question didn't turn up in my searching until I added the word &quot;useful&quot;. The answer is fine&amp;mdash;as far as it goes.  But this would be a great place to explain the pros and cons of indexing. (The number one con is that a good index is harder than it looks.) **Needs Improvement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1267/using-nook-outside-the-us**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shows up on the first page of results and is pretty clear about the answer for the fairly narrow question. (Can you load books in the EPUB format outside of the US? Yes.) But there are lots of answers that come before in the search results that are more detailed. The question could use some editing and the comment on the question outscores the answer (and is more detailed to boot). If I landed on the ebooks.SE result, I'd probably hit the back button and look elsewhere. **Needs Improvement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1249/converting-raw-text-to-epub**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A [Super User question](https://superuser.com/questions/34619/how-do-i-convert-a-text-file-to-the-epub-format) outranks this one unless I add the word &quot;raw&quot; to my search results. I actually prefer the answer here, but because the search terms I used are a bit unlikely, this is only a **Satisfactory** result.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1275/setting-up-margins-in-epub-and-kindle-ebooks-and-page-rule**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Top result in my search, well-written question, and a useful answer. The one niggle I have is that the OP's comment was left unaddressed. Even so, **Excellent**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1276/body-text-formatting-and-text-indentation-for-kindle-ebooks** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't bother to search for this question since I count two separate queries. The OP should have been instructed to ask a new question about paragraph indentation. **Needs Improvement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1251/how-to-convert-an-html5-and-jquery-featured-e-book-to-an-executable-fileexe-h**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, I was able to find this question easily enough; it ranked higher than a number of services to do what the question is asking. But the answer is somewhat sparse. Really, the question isn't great since the OP really needs to explain what their problem actually is. It's a classic [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem). **Needs Improvement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1297/how-to-convert-scanned-pdf-to-text**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I searched several different ways and couldn't find this question. The answer was spot on and useful, but there are just too many services that dominate the PageRank for the relevant search terms. **Needs Improvement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1255/how-to-extract-epub-file-up-to-chapter-one-and-create-new-epub-with-extracted-co**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ebooks.SE comes up on top in my searching. Unfortunately, this question is behind: https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1069/how-can-i-extract-some-chapters-or-sections-from-an-ebook-into-a-new-one Given the choice, I'd prefer several narrower questions to the more general one. But the EPUB-specific answer is darn useful in any case. **Satisfactory**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1241/how-can-i-toggle-text-reliably-across-all-ereaders-in-an-epub-file**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I appreciate the question _and_ the answer. It's odd that the answer hasn't been upvoted; perhaps if [this comment were edited in](https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/q/1242/#comment1526_1242) it would be. I found the question after adding the word &quot;toggle&quot; to my search. **Satisfactory**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More than most sites I've reviewed, ebooks.SE lacks a serious presence in Google's index. I don't know why and I wish I did. It's not often that a Stack Exchange site has a sudden drop in traffic that can't be explained by Google changing their algorithm. But this site has fallen dramatically since mid-March:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![ebooks.SE Quantcast traffic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/94UtQ.png)](https://www.quantcast.com/ebooks.stackexchange.com)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I admit I was one of the [86%](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/46400) who failed to follow through on their commitment. But I'm puzzled about what's gone wrong here. Other than a severe drop in traffic and a somewhat challenging search space, I can't pinpoint any particular causes." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is&#xD;&#xA;apparently starting slowly, and I have been trying to contribute to&#xD;&#xA;its attractiveness, with whatever knowledge and time I have, since I&#xD;&#xA;think ebooks are a very important topic, technically and culturally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contributing takes time, as I know from doing it on other sites. It&#xD;&#xA;also takes many forms. We are suppose to use this site keeping in mind&#xD;&#xA;that questions are never only for the asker, but are to be an&#xD;&#xA;available resource, together with answers, for future users interested&#xD;&#xA;by the issue. Hence it is important that questions be clear and&#xD;&#xA;informative. This is why questions are supposed to show some research&#xD;&#xA;effort, and to contribute whatever knowledge the asker has already&#xD;&#xA;gathered on the issue. It helps future users, and it helps focus&#xD;&#xA;answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthemore, it is always hard to know whether a missing or apparently&#xD;&#xA;inconsistent information in the question is due to ignorance by the&#xD;&#xA;asker, or carelessness on his part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course the same holds for answers. Answers are not always complete&#xD;&#xA;answers, but are supposed at least to contribute data to a partial&#xD;&#xA;answer. Partial answers are particularly fair when a question has&#xD;&#xA;remained totally unanswered  for 6 months, and when the comments&#xD;&#xA;indicate that it is not even clear to some users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is precisely the case for question&#xD;&#xA;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/6058/how-to-automatically-hyphenate-before-sending-to-a-device/6413?noredirect=1#comment3752_6413. And&#xD;&#xA;the 7 comments are evidence to its lack of clarity. The OP&#xD;&#xA;takes as an excuse the fact that English is not his native language,&#xD;&#xA;but he clearly masters it well enough (BTW, it is not my native&#xD;&#xA;language either).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The OP asked a very terse question, that was not even well phrased. He&#xD;&#xA;did not show any research, and even withheld what information he had&#xD;&#xA;on the topic, as proved by his later comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being interested in the issue, I did some search on my own. In my&#xD;&#xA;answer I provided more explanation that should have been in the&#xD;&#xA;question (but I thought it would be editing it too much), and that the&#xD;&#xA;OP had not bothered giving despite obvious misunderstanding and&#xD;&#xA;explicit requests in comments (but it was not clear at that point that&#xD;&#xA;he knew that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also gave a reference to a tool that did at least part of what he&#xD;&#xA;wanted. He also knew about that tool, but gave no hint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally he criticized my answer in a comment, which is fair&#xD;&#xA;enough. However I told him that his question was not up to standard,&#xD;&#xA;and that my answer was a consequence of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So he concluded with a rude comment, and downvoted my answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally never downvote, because I think it is useless in all non&#xD;&#xA;obvious cases, and often unfair. And obvious cases are ... obvious,&#xD;&#xA;and probably better handled by flags. I believe in discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think the behavior of users like the OP of the question I&#xD;&#xA;am discussing is detrimental to the site. He contributes nothing and&#xD;&#xA;discourages arrogantly those who try to contribute.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I have gone out of my way to provide useful information to people who ask questions. I have done my best to follow SE  guidelines and to make people aware of guidelines. I have contributed to several other SE, so it's fair to say that I know SE  expectations and SE culture.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I run an ebook publishing company and I have written about the ebook industry for a while. I know a lot of things about ebook technology and standards. I format ebooks everyday and work as an editor in Katy, TX . I also am a writer and geek. I have gone out of my way to publicize the ebook SE on another websites. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have tried my best to be helpful and polite, especially to newbies who may be unfamiliar with SE rules. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the same time, I see a lot of effort on this SE to remove posts and answers even when it is unwarranted. This has happened to me several times. Sometimes the judgment is questionable or based on an alleged infraction which is borderline or debateable. I am an advocate for loose enforcement of SE guidelines -- mainly because it alienates people. Also, because I understand that it takes time to learn the rules, and I want to be helpful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today, Ed Cotrell deleted my answer  to explain to a new user about the right way to find an answer to his off-topic question. My answer was appropriate, polite and still helpful. HERE IS THE QUESTION WITH THE DELETED ANSWER: https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/7448/i-need-recommendations/7450?noredirect=1#comment4854_7450&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So why was it deleted? Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I call b.s. on that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, I answer ebook questions almost every day. According to Ed Cotrell's profile, he hasn't answered a single question in almost  2 years on this SE. He mainly deletes answers and closes questions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third,  my answer was helpful and polite. Cotrell's answer was classic deletionism. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer allows that. Please note that I did make a comment to the question, as is customary on SE. Additionally, I posted a longer answer. That is beyond what is necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell is infuriating to me. It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners. It mis-applies an SE  rule. It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this were the only time this sort of thing  happened, I would let it pass. But this happens to me and others on a regular basis on the Ebook SE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, I have decided to permanently leave the Ebook SE. Please note that I will continue contributing to the Writers SE and some of the other SE. But I grow weary of this nonsense. Why bother trying to contribute if there's someone else who is deleting my answers for dubious reasons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can find me at https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/ , the Kindle formatting forums and obviously on #eprdctn&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robert Nagle idiotprogrammer@gmail.com " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I have gone out of my way to provide useful information to people who ask questions. I have done my best to follow SE  guidelines and to make people aware of guidelines.

HERE IS THE QUESTION WITH THE DELETED ANSWER: https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/7448/i-need-recommendations/7450?noredirect=1#comment4854_7450&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So why was it deleted? Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I call b.s. on that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, I answer ebook questions almost every day. According to Ed Cotrell's profile, he hasn't answered a single question in almost  2 years on this SE. He mainly deletes answers and closes questions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third,  my answer was helpful and polite. Cotrell's answer was classic deletionism. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer field allows that. Please note that I did make a comment to the question, as is customary on SE. Additionally, I posted a longer answer. That is beyond what is necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell is infuriating to me. It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners. It mis-applies a SE  rule. It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this were the only time this sort of thing  happened, I would let it pass. But this happens to me and others on a regular basis on the Ebook SE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, I have decided to permanently leave the Ebook SE. Please note that I will continue contributing to the Writers SE and some of the other SE. But I grow weary of this nonsense. Why bother trying to contribute if there's someone else who is deleting my answers for dubious reasons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can find me at https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/ , the Kindle formatting forums and obviously on #eprdctn&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robert Nagle idiotprogrammer@gmail.com " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example, Reddit has many interesting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subreddits dedicated to special topics.

On the other hand,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; these guidelines also allow the topics to stay focused on questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that can be answered objectively. Hope this helps...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I should point out three things before we go any further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **The question was off-topic and unsalvageable.** You even cast the first vote to close it for being off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;2. **You made no attempt to answer the (off-topic) question** by recommending books. Your &quot;answer&quot; was commentary about why the question was off-topic. Note: I'm not saying you *should* have offered recommendations. I'm saying your &quot;answer&quot; wasn't an answer.&#xD;&#xA;3. You posted your &quot;answer&quot; on October 7. It didn't come to my attention until October 16. **For 9 days, it was there and visible to the entire world.** That was more than long enough to serve its purpose of communicating to the OP. In fact, it was long enough for several users, including the OP, to see it and comment, and for you to post a reply comment yourself:&#xD;&#xA;[![comments on the deleted post][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Your Comments Above&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to address some of your comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;At the same time, I see a lot of effort on this SE to remove posts and answers even when it is unwarranted. This has happened to me several times. Sometimes the judgment is questionable or based on an alleged infraction which is borderline or debateable. I am an advocate for loose enforcement of SE guidelines -- mainly because strict enforcement of guidelines is usually unnecessary and alienates people. Also, I feel that way because I understand that it takes time for newbies to learn the SE mores, and I want to be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no effort to remove posts &quot;when it is unwarranted.&quot; We do, however, follow a question-and-answer format. Your &quot;answer&quot; wasn't an answer. I'm sure by now you've read the guidelines on [how to answer questions here](https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer), so I'm assuming you knew that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Today, moderator Ed Cotrell [sic] deleted my answer to explain to a new user about the right way to find an answer to his off-topic question. My answer was appropriate, polite and still helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did delete it. It wasn't an answer. See above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;So why was it deleted? Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;I call b.s. on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It had nothing to do with whether the answer was &quot;appropriate&quot; or &quot;in the appropriate form.&quot; It literally did not answer the question. It was an extended comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;According to Ed Cotrell's [sic] profile, he hasn't answered a single ebook question in almost 2 years on this SE. He mainly does moderation: deleting answers and voting to close things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Guilty as charged, at least with respect to answering questions recently. I am more of a student in this space than a teacher, and I have a few other things on my plate. I was, however, asked to help moderate the site until it can hold moderator elections, and I'm happy to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;True, but I'm not sure why that's relevant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Third, my answer was helpful and polite. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, it wasn't an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Cotrell's [sic] response was classic deletionism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please spell my name right, if you're going to use it so many times. And I like the phrase &quot;classic deletionism.&quot; I'm going to have to start using that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not as a comment underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer field allows that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a reason comments are limited in length: we don't *want* extremely long how-to posts every time someone asks an off-topic question. The sites on the SE network get thousands of off-topic, nonsensical, incoherent, overly broad, or otherwise bad questions per day. We don't want users reposting the entire Help section in the answers (or the comments) to all of those questions. And in any case, &quot;I needed more space&quot; does not convert a series of comments into an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell [sic] is infuriating to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry to hear that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. It removed a non-answer to an off-topic question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It mis-applies a SE rule.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Respectfully, no.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Furthermore, I might have brought this up individually with Mr. Cotrell [sic], but apparently he's keeping his email a secret and the SE application doesn't have the functionality of direct messaging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't post my email on SE because, among other reasons, I also moderate Stack Overflow. I get enough email without hundreds of complaints about who knows what flooding my inbox every day. People already send nasty messages to SO moderatos and stalk us on Twitter and in other contexts all the time. I'd rather they not also spam me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Posting something on META is literally the only way that SE allows you to protest a moderator's action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have a function that lets you flag a post for moderator attention. I'm not the only moderator, and I would not handle a flag complaining about my actions. Also, you could have posted on Meta without simultaneously quitting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, I hope you'll reconsider your decision to leave, or at least seek a constructive dialog.

Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I call b.s. on that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, I answer ebook questions on this SE several times each week, sometimes even daily. According to Ed Cotrell's profile, he hasn't answered a single ebook question in almost  2 years on this SE. He mainly does moderation: deleting answers and voting to close things.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third,  my answer was helpful and polite. Cotrell's response was classic deletionism. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not as a comment underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer field allows that. Please note that I did make a comment to the question, as is customary on SE. Additionally, I posted a longer answer. That is beyond what is necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell is infuriating to me. It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners. It mis-applies a SE  rule. It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, I might have brought this up individually with Mr. Cotrell, but apparently he's keeping his email a secret and the SE application doesn't have the functionality of direct messaging. Posting something on META is  literally the only way that SE allows you to protest a moderator's action. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this were the only time this sort of thing  happened, I would let it pass. But this happens to me and others on a semi-regular basis on the Ebook SE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, I have decided to permanently leave the Ebook SE. Please note that I will continue contributing to the Writers SE and some of the other SE. But I grow weary of this nonsense.

Because the content and meaning of the announcement is the same for both sites, I have not edited it to be specific to Ebooks. But, because it impacts both sites, I feel it is important for me to post it in both locations.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Prologue&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Earlier today, I resigned as a moderator on both Stack Overflow and Ebooks. I feel I owe this community some attempt at an explanation. Please understand that I cannot offer a full explanation of everything that led me to this decision. This is likely going to strike many people as vague, inadequate, and unsatisfying. For that I apologize.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Background&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you may be aware, there is an ongoing wave of moderator resignations and at least one firing across the Stack Exchange network, as summarized and collected in [this post on Meta SE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper). You may also have heard or read in the above post or posts linked therein that there are many frustrated moderators in the SE network right now. That much is true. There's no point rehashing all of it here. And I do not want to publish private or confidential information, so I will not be adding any details or disclosures about what has happened, is going on now, or may be happening in the future. The astute reader can likely figure out 95% of it, anyway. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#My Decision&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am resigning primarily due to the same events that led to many of the resignations in the above list. Recent events—many of which are not and will never be public, others of which are not *yet* public—have forced me to two conclusions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Sadly, I can no longer serve as a moderator on Stack Overflow or Ebooks in good conscience, and&#xD;&#xA;2. I no longer want to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I set out on my moderator journey in January 2014, when I was [asked to serve as a moderator *pro tempore*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/07/27/moderator-pro-tempore/) on Ebooks after following it and participating in it as early as its Area 51 proposal. In November 2015, I was honored to be [elected as a moderator](https://stackoverflow.com/election/7) on Stack Overflow. Both times, I undertook the obligations, duties, responsibilities, and privileges of being a moderator because I loved and believed in the community in question, appreciated the robust rules and norms each had developed, and wanted to give back to communities that had helped me so much. When I stepped down on SO for several months due to major changes in my personal life and severe time constraints, I came back when my time freed up only because I *still* believed in the community and *still* wanted to help it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My resignation is the other side of that coin: I simply will not be able to serve these communities as a moderator in the future, and so I must resign. Many policies, facts, and events have played a role in this, but as I have said above, I cannot fully explain them here. I have wrestled with how to explain exactly what led to my decision to resign.

The best answer I can give comes from two of my comments below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Comment 1:](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731801_390025) Please understand that, just as I can’t explain all of my reasons for resigning, I can’t explain all of the reasons that is so. It may help you to understand that I am an attorney “in real life.” That creates a huge number of obligations to refrain from speaking about various situations or issues. Let me be extremely clear that I’m not (1) saying that legal issues had anything to do with my resignation, (2) accusing anyone of lying or anything else, or (3) stating any legal opinions on anything. I am saying that I, personally, cannot offer the kind of explanation people might want. Full stop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[Comment 2:](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731869_390030) All of us are subject to various limits on our conduct—legally, ethically, professionally, or otherwise—which I am willing to believe all of us take very seriously. Some of us are subject to more such constraints than others. If you look at the list of resignations in the MSE post that I linked to under background, you will see that several former moderators offer detailed explanations of their decisions. Nobody—as far as I know—is trying to hide anything that should be public, but that doesn’t mean we are at liberty to say whatever we want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What's Next&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What happens now? I'm not sure. I am weighing whether and to what extent it makes sense for me to continue to participate on SO, Ebooks, or other SE sites. I'm going to take a break from them for a bit, in any case.

I will no longer participate on the sites I previously moderated or on any other Stack Exchange sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This decision was forced upon me, as Stack Exchange (the company) has breached the trust of its users, especially its volunteer moderators, and has shown no interest in repairing the harms it has inflicted on the community, including specific harms to the reputation of one of the most-respected moderators in the network’s history. The company has made clear that these errors and changes are permanent and beyond question or debate. Indeed, its handling of recent developments has shown that it intends to continue to lead by fiat, without meaningful input from users. That is the company’s prerogative, but this course of action makes these sites inhospitable and unworthy places to invest my limited time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In light of these facts, I cannot and will not further contribute here.

I'm aware the legality of this may be debatable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Context: I've bought a paper book, but after more than 3 weeks I'm still waiting.  I need the book in preparation for a deadline that is coming up soon, so I intend to buy the ebook.  Sources for the ebook that I can find are in EPUB format with DRM from Adobe Digital Editions, which apparently does not work (well) on my Linux computer, which means I cannot (properly) read the ebook unless I remove DRM first.  There may be ways to do that, but would asking so be on-topic on this site?

The company has made clear that these errors and changes are permanent and beyond question or debate.

I hope you'll reconsider rather than rage-quitting.&#xA;&#xA;I'll offer a few points in response to your comments.&#xA;&#xA;# The Deleted Post&#xA;&#xA;First, for those who can't see [the post I deleted](https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/a/7450/38) (which is nearly everyone), here it is:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Oh, gosh, I hate to break the news to you, but Stack Exchange has lots&#xA;&gt; of rules about the types and rules of what you can ask or post about.&#xA;&gt; Each SE has different guidelines, so you might want to check the one&#xA;&gt; for the ebook SE:  https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; You might find another SE which is more relevant to your question. (A&#xA;&gt; big list is here: https://stackexchange.com/sites#lifearts  See for&#xA;&gt; example the sci/fi -- fantasy SE. https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&#xA;&gt; Generally though, a lot of SE try to discourage people from asking&#xA;&gt; recommendation questions of the sort you are asking. &#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; Many other sites out there might have more open (and less constrictive&#xA;&gt; ) discussion policies. For example, Reddit has many interesting&#xA;&gt; subreddits dedicated to special topics. I just found one for Sci Fi&#xA;&gt; readings which might be interesting to you.&#xA;&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/scifibooks/&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; A common complaint about SE is that its strict guidelines for&#xA;&gt; questions tends to discourage open-ended answers. On the other hand,&#xA;&gt; these guidelines also allow the topics to stay focused on questions&#xA;&gt; that can be answered objectively. Hope this helps...&#xA;&#xA;I should point out three things before we go any further.&#xA;&#xA;1. **The question was off-topic and unsalvageable.** You even cast the first vote to close it for being off-topic.&#xA;2. **You made no attempt to answer the (off-topic) question** by recommending books. Your &quot;answer&quot; was commentary about why the question was off-topic. Note: I'm not saying you *should* have offered recommendations. I'm saying your &quot;answer&quot; wasn't an answer.&#xA;3. You posted your &quot;answer&quot; on October 7. It didn't come to my attention until October 16. **For 9 days, it was there and visible to the entire world.** That was more than long enough to serve its purpose of communicating to the OP. In fact, it was long enough for several users, including the OP, to see it and comment, and for you to post a reply comment yourself:&#xA;[![comments on the deleted post][1]][1]&#xA;&#xA;# Your Comments Above&#xA;&#xA;I'll try to address some of your comments.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;At the same time, I see a lot of effort on this SE to remove posts and answers even when it is unwarranted. This has happened to me several times. Sometimes the judgment is questionable or based on an alleged infraction which is borderline or debateable. I am an advocate for loose enforcement of SE guidelines -- mainly because strict enforcement of guidelines is usually unnecessary and alienates people. Also, I feel that way because I understand that it takes time for newbies to learn the SE mores, and I want to be helpful.&#xA;&#xA;There is no effort to remove posts &quot;when it is unwarranted.&quot; We do, however, follow a question-and-answer format. Your &quot;answer&quot; wasn't an answer. I'm sure by now you've read the guidelines on [how to answer questions here](https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer), so I'm assuming you knew that.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Today, moderator Ed Cotrell [sic] deleted my answer to explain to a new user about the right way to find an answer to his off-topic question. My answer was appropriate, polite and still helpful.&#xA;&#xA;I did delete it. It wasn't an answer. See above.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;So why was it deleted? Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;I call b.s. on that.&#xA;&#xA;It had nothing to do with whether the answer was &quot;appropriate&quot; or &quot;in the appropriate form.&quot; It literally did not answer the question. It was an extended comment.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;According to Ed Cotrell's [sic] profile, he hasn't answered a single ebook question in almost 2 years on this SE. He mainly does moderation: deleting answers and voting to close things.&#xA;&#xA;Guilty as charged, at least with respect to answering questions recently. I am more of a student in this space than a teacher, and I have a few other things on my plate. I was, however, asked to help moderate the site until it can hold moderator elections, and I'm happy to do so.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's [sic] bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.&#xA;&#xA;True, but I'm not sure why that's relevant.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Third, my answer was helpful and polite. &#xA;&#xA;Again, it wasn't an answer.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Cotrell's [sic] response was classic deletionism.&#xA;&#xA;Please spell my name correctly, if you're going to use it so many times. And I like the phrase &quot;classic deletionism.&quot; I'm going to have to start using that.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not as a comment underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer field allows that.&#xA;&#xA;There is a reason comments are limited in length: we don't *want* extremely long how-to posts every time someone asks an off-topic question. The sites on the SE network get thousands of off-topic, nonsensical, incoherent, overly broad, or otherwise bad questions per day. We don't want users reposting the entire Help section in the answers (or the comments) to all of those questions. And in any case, &quot;I needed more space&quot; does not convert a series of comments into an answer.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell [sic] is infuriating to me.&#xA;&#xA;Sorry to hear that.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners.&#xA;&#xA;Nope. It removed a non-answer to an off-topic question.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;It mis-applies a SE rule.&#xA;&#xA;Respectfully, no.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users.&#xA;&#xA;Nope.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Furthermore, I might have brought this up individually with Mr. Cotrell [sic], but apparently he's keeping his email a secret and the SE application doesn't have the functionality of direct messaging.&#xA;&#xA;I don't post my email on SE because, among other reasons, I also moderate Stack Overflow. I get enough email without hundreds of complaints about who-knows-what (that likely didn't even involve me) flooding my inbox every day. People already send nasty messages to SO moderators and stalk us on Twitter and in other contexts all the time. I'd rather they not also spam me.&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Posting something on META is literally the only way that SE allows you to protest a moderator's action.&#xA;&#xA;We have a function that lets you flag a post for moderator attention. I'm not the only moderator, and I would not handle a flag complaining about my actions. Also, you could have posted on Meta without simultaneously quitting.&#xA;&#xA;Again, I hope you'll reconsider your decision to leave, or at least seek a constructive dialog. Rage-quitting the site doesn't make it better.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuoiI.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They're annoying, but they are part of life, and they're part of the peril of participating in a site where the person asking the question may not understand the issues (see the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/238426)). After all, someone's always [wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/).&#xA;&#xA;There's nothing here to do but move on and not take it personally. After all, as of right now, you have a net +1 score on that answer (worth a net +18 reputation). The -2 reputation just isn't a big deal.&#xA;&#xA;You should be aware, however, that your comment exchange on your answer probably didn't help you. I've cleaned up the comments because some of them weren't constructive, but one of your comments was this:&#xA;&#xA;&gt;The point is that you are supposed to write clear questions, and give context. You did not. You may consider that I did not answer you: your priviledge [sic]. The point is that you do not respect the intention of this site which is to constitute a collection of good questions with good answer that can help many people. Your question is bad, because it is too terse to be fully clear (not just my opinion) and does not give the context you already know. English is not the native language of many users, but this is not the issue.&#xA;&#xA;That comes across as a lecture at best and an ad hominem insult at worst. It does not come across as constructive criticism. In the future, you may want to remember that getting into sharp discussions with people and questioning their sincerity or motives is not likely to provoke a good response. It certainly boosts the odds of a downvote, fair or unfair, in the context of this site.&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;This is not technically part of the answer to your question, but it's still relevant to the reasoning behind your question.&#xA;&#xA;One thing jumped out at me about your post. You wrote:&#xA;&#xA;&gt;I personally never downvote, because I think it is useless in all non obvious cases, and often unfair. And obvious cases are ... obvious, and probably better handled by flags. I believe in discussion.&#xA;&#xA;You *should* downvote when appropriate. The tooltip/mouseover text for the downvote button is informative:&#xA;&#xA;&gt;[For questions:] This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;[For answers:] This answer is not useful&#xA;&#xA;If the post is unclear, not useful, or just lazy, you *should* downvote it. Downvotes are critical to the way Stack Exchange sites like this one work: we rely on upvotes to move good content up *and downvotes to move bad content down*.&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;*Note: I am not saying you should or should not have downvoted the question at issue, and I'm not weighing in on whether or not the OP's vote against your question was justified, assuming it really was the OP who cast the downvote.*&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For those who are not familiar, here's a summary (courtesy of Jon Ericson):&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Most of you probably remember previous years’ events, but I’ll recap&#xA;&gt; anyway, for the newbies among us. Winter Bash is an annual event that&#xA;&gt; can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users&#xA;&gt; earn “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (analogous&#xA;&gt; to badges). Certain actions trigger the user receiving a hat, which&#xA;&gt; their gravatar can “wear”. We track everyone’s progress earning hats&#xA;&gt; in a leaderboard that looks something like this:&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;![enter image description here][1]&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; Winter Bash 2014 will again be available to all sites that choose to&#xA;&gt; participate. We’re redesigning all the hats and adding some extra&#xA;&gt; features to keep things fresh and exciting.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; **Some Details**&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; This event will run from 15 December 2014 to 4 January 2015. Users&#xA;&gt; will be able to see their entire hat collection on&#xA;&gt; [winterbash2014.stackexchange.com](http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com). That site will also have a landing&#xA;&gt; page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see&#xA;&gt; hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option&#xA;&gt; available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats&#xA;&gt; will go back into storage. &#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be&#xA;&gt; the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;This is a fun event, so I personally recommend that we participate. Please chime in in the answers with your own feelings on the topic. Unless there is a strong anti-hat vibe out there in the ebook world, we will be bustin' out all sorts of weird headgear.&#xA;&#xA;[1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/pl9TB.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Because the content and meaning of the announcement is the same for both sites, I have not edited it to be specific to Ebooks. But, because it impacts both sites, I feel it is important for me to post it in both locations.*&#xA;&#xA;# Prologue&#xA;&#xA;Earlier today, I resigned as a moderator on both Stack Overflow and Ebooks. I feel I owe this community some attempt at an explanation. Please understand that I cannot offer a full explanation of everything that led me to this decision. This is likely going to strike many people as vague, inadequate, and unsatisfying. For that I apologize.&#xA;&#xA;# Background&#xA;&#xA;As you may be aware, there is an ongoing wave of moderator resignations and at least one firing across the Stack Exchange network, as summarized and collected in [this post on Meta SE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper). You may also have heard or read in the above post or posts linked therein that there are many frustrated moderators in the SE network right now. That much is true. There's no point rehashing all of it here. And I do not want to publish private or confidential information, so I will not be adding any details or disclosures about what has happened, is going on now, or may be happening in the future. The astute reader can likely figure out 95% of it, anyway. &#xA;&#xA;# My Decision&#xA;&#xA;I am resigning primarily due to the same events that led to many of the resignations in the above list. Recent events—many of which are not and will never be public, others of which are not *yet* public—have forced me to two conclusions:&#xA;&#xA;1. Sadly, I can no longer serve as a moderator on Stack Overflow or Ebooks in good conscience, and&#xA;2. I no longer want to do so.&#xA;&#xA;I set out on my moderator journey in January 2014, when I was [asked to serve as a moderator *pro tempore*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/07/27/moderator-pro-tempore/) on Ebooks after following it and participating in it as early as its Area 51 proposal. In November 2015, I was honored to be [elected as a moderator](https://stackoverflow.com/election/7) on Stack Overflow. Both times, I undertook the obligations, duties, responsibilities, and privileges of being a moderator because I loved and believed in the community in question, appreciated the robust rules and norms each had developed, and wanted to give back to communities that had helped me so much. When I stepped down on SO for several months due to major changes in my personal life and severe time constraints, I came back when my time freed up only because I *still* believed in the community and *still* wanted to help it.&#xA;&#xA;My resignation is the other side of that coin: I simply will not be able to serve these communities as a moderator in the future, and so I must resign. Many policies, facts, and events have played a role in this, but as I have said above, I cannot fully explain them here. I have wrestled with how to explain exactly what led to my decision to resign. I have concluded that I cannot offer much detail without leaving out even more and muddying the waters.&#xA;&#xA;**Edit** to address a common question in the answers and comments on Stack Overflow: Many have asked why I cannot explain my reasoning. The best answer I can give comes from two of my comments below:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; [Comment 1:](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731801_390025) Please understand that, just as I can’t explain all of my reasons for resigning, I can’t explain all of the reasons that is so. It may help you to understand that I am an attorney “in real life.” That creates a huge number of obligations to refrain from speaking about various situations or issues. Let me be extremely clear that I’m not (1) saying that legal issues had anything to do with my resignation, (2) accusing anyone of lying or anything else, or (3) stating any legal opinions on anything. I am saying that I, personally, cannot offer the kind of explanation people might want. Full stop.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;[Comment 2:](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731869_390030) All of us are subject to various limits on our conduct—legally, ethically, professionally, or otherwise—which I am willing to believe all of us take very seriously. Some of us are subject to more such constraints than others. If you look at the list of resignations in the MSE post that I linked to under background, you will see that several former moderators offer detailed explanations of their decisions. Nobody—as far as I know—is trying to hide anything that should be public, but that doesn’t mean we are at liberty to say whatever we want.&#xA;&#xA;# What's Next&#xA;&#xA;What happens now? I'm not sure. I am weighing whether and to what extent it makes sense for me to continue to participate on SO, Ebooks, or other SE sites. I'm going to take a break from them for a bit, in any case. It's going to take a good, long while to wash out of my brain [some](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/354236/2057919) of the [things](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/338297/2057919) (images, rants, or otherwise) I've encountered as a moderator, and getting my brain out of &quot;moderator mode&quot; seems in order.&#xA;&#xA;I have been honored to serve this community. Thank you, and I wish you all the best." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
