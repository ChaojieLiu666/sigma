To me, this is as much a &quot;shopping list&quot; question as my question is, resulting in similar link recommendation replies as my question does. In fact, the example question even goes beyond that, as it asks for &quot;product recommendations&quot;, which is more &quot;shopping-list&quot; than my question. At least from my point of view. And to be sure no one thinks my example wasn't random enough, let me point to another random example which results in similar &quot;product recommendation&quot; answers: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/9/clean-up-converted-ebook&quot;&gt;Clean up converted ebook&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting the eBook community decide…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh well, may the moderators and the community decide what to do with my question. Personally, I won't be angry if it stays live (I mean, there was a reason for me to post it in the first place). But the world won't fall apart for me if the community decides it is best to delete my question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See, in cases like these, I tend to go with the flow and comply with the general consensus for the benefit of the community.

Fundamentally, spam tries to sell you something when you didn't ask for anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some spam is after your money. Sometimes it's indirect, such as spam that wants you to visit a website and click on the ads. Some spam wants you to visit a website with malware that may be able to infect your computer. Sometimes spam is after things other than money; political spam is still spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you'll see posts from broken spam bots that only have the framing but are missing a reference to the brand or site being advertised. Treat them as spam. Stack Exchange has some technical measures designed to limit spam, so the proportion of spams from bot tests rather than from working bots is quite high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some things, however, are not spam:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wildly off-topic questions are not spam. Vote to close, perhaps flag as low quality, but do not flag them as spam.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nonsense posts that aren't clearly the product of a bot are not spam. Flag as low quality or “not an answer”, possibly downvote (and vote to delete if you have that privilege).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;I saw a spam post, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag as spam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flagging as spam is the most effective way of dealing with spam. A post that receives 6 spam flags is automatically deleted and locked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't raise a custom flag, select the “it is spam” predefined reason. That gives extra work to moderators as they need to handle the custom flag separately. Moderators see spam flags, and generally react to them by destroying the account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't bother downvoting spam&lt;/strong&gt;. It's actually counterproductive for questions as they are taken off the front page if their score drops below -4. A spam flag already reduces the post's score by 1. (But don't upvote either: we don't want to risk giving the spammer privileges, or to say to the quality control system that there is something worth saving on that account.) There's also no need to vote to close a spam question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't edit the post to blank out the spam, except for when the post contains p*rn. This makes it harder for others to notice that the post is spam and must be removed pronto. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;I saw a spam edit, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most spammers post questions or answers but some try to sneak in spam via edits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reject spam edits, or edits that are testing bots, as vandalism. There is currently no separate tracking for spam and other kinds of vandalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to edits that add links — most are helpful (adding a link to a paper or to Wikipedia), but occasionally the link is to a spam or phishing or malware site, so check the targets of links when you review suggested edits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How can I help fight spam most effectively?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag as spam&lt;/strong&gt; and move on. Really, that's the most helpful thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one other thing: if other people with a Stack Exchange account are around (in real life, or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;), you might ask them to flag as well, especially in the slow hours when there are few people around on the site. This is highly effective if you happen to participate or visit any highly active chatrooms. Anyone with 15 reputation can flag.

Also, as Chris Rea points out, simply using the country name is better for search engine reasons (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/country-agnostic&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;country-agnostic&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;country-agnostic&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful. I'm not sure about that one, since simply not picking a country tag would have the same effect. The approach that Chris describes in his comment (country names when necessary, no tag for questions that apply broadly) seems best to me for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It dawns on me that we are probably also going to need &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/law&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;law&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;.

That is, I don't think we're at a point where we need to go on a massive re-tagging campaign. We need to wait and see how often given questions come up. For example, is having tags for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/germany&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;germany&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/france&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;france&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;france&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/italy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;italy&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;italy&lt;/a&gt; really the way to go?

Many users pick tags to draw attention, rather than to limit answers. On some SE sites, that's actually the norm. Even on SO, answers like &quot;don't use [some tool/library/method mentioned in the question] for this&quot; are often appropriate and score highly. So, sometimes, a question is tagged with a restrictive tag, but context indicates the OP is open to answers not relevant to the tag. Other times, the tag isn't there, but the question indicates it should be. These, of course, are reasons why we have re-tagging edits and commenting on posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, both your understandings were reasonable, but I think the best approach is to encourage the OP to remove a tag that incorrectly narrows the scope of possible answers.

We could find errors and then ask questions about how to fix them, though, which may be what you had in mind. My suggestion would be that we pick a Creative Commons (or other open licensed) book to go over. Rather than doing full critiques, we post the issues we find as questions. We can then link to the relevant book, and have no worries about duplicating code or content in posts because of the open licenses.

For those who are not familiar, here's a summary (courtesy of Jon Ericson):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of you probably remember previous years’ events, but I’ll recap&#xA;anyway, for the newbies among us. Winter Bash is an annual event that&#xA;can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users&#xA;earn “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (analogous&#xA;to badges). Certain actions trigger the user receiving a hat, which&#xA;their gravatar can “wear”. We track everyone’s progress earning hats&#xA;in a leaderboard that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pl9TB.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winter Bash 2014 will again be available to all sites that choose to&#xA;participate. We’re redesigning all the hats and adding some extra&#xA;features to keep things fresh and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This event will run from 15 December 2014 to 4 January 2015. Users&#xA;will be able to see their entire hat collection on&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;winterbash2014.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;. That site will also have a landing&#xA;page, explaining the rules and other details of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see&#xA;hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option&#xA;available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats&#xA;will go back into storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be&#xA;the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a fun event, so I personally recommend that we participate. Please chime in in the answers with your own feelings on the topic.

Or those that are not bothering to look in the help center are likely to ignore also more visible link or picture on the homepage?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, right now that page is very concise, it states the scope of the site briefly; I think that its contents are adequate and fully understandable for everyone that bothers to read it, but maybe it can be improved as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/q/4673/136&quot;&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; just today! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="136" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:00:05.460" LastActivityDate="2015-01-10T15:36:13.490" Title="Should we make the scope of this site clearer?"

It is&#xA;apparently starting slowly, and I have been trying to contribute to&#xA;its attractiveness, with whatever knowledge and time I have, since I&#xA;think ebooks are a very important topic, technically and culturally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contributing takes time, as I know from doing it on other sites. It&#xA;also takes many forms. We are suppose to use this site keeping in mind&#xA;that questions are never only for the asker, but are to be an&#xA;available resource, together with answers, for future users interested&#xA;by the issue. Hence it is important that questions be clear and&#xA;informative. This is why questions are supposed to show some research&#xA;effort, and to contribute whatever knowledge the asker has already&#xA;gathered on the issue. It helps future users, and it helps focus&#xA;answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthemore, it is always hard to know whether a missing or apparently&#xA;inconsistent information in the question is due to ignorance by the&#xA;asker, or carelessness on his part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the same holds for answers. Answers are not always complete&#xA;answers, but are supposed at least to contribute data to a partial&#xA;answer. Partial answers are particularly fair when a question has&#xA;remained totally unanswered  for 6 months, and when the comments&#xA;indicate that it is not even clear to some users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the case for question&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/6058/how-to-automatically-hyphenate-before-sending-to-a-device/6413?noredirect=1#comment3752_6413&quot;&gt;How to automatically hyphenate before sending to a device?&lt;/a&gt;. And&#xA;the 7 comments are evidence to its lack of clarity. The OP&#xA;takes as an excuse the fact that English is not his native language,&#xA;but he clearly masters it well enough (BTW, it is not my native&#xA;language either).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OP asked a very terse question, that was not even well phrased. He&#xA;did not show any research, and even withheld what information he had&#xA;on the topic, as proved by his later comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being interested in the issue, I did some search on my own.

I've cleaned up the comments because some of them weren't constructive, but one of your comments was this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that you are supposed to write clear questions, and give context. You did not. You may consider that I did not answer you: your priviledge [sic]. The point is that you do not respect the intention of this site which is to constitute a collection of good questions with good answer that can help many people. Your question is bad, because it is too terse to be fully clear (not just my opinion) and does not give the context you already know. English is not the native language of many users, but this is not the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That comes across as a lecture at best and an ad hominem insult at worst. It does not come across as constructive criticism.

It certainly boosts the odds of a downvote, fair or unfair, in the context of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not technically part of the answer to your question, but it's still relevant to the reasoning behind your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing jumped out at me about your post.

I have gone out of my way to provide useful information to people who ask questions. I have done my best to follow SE  guidelines and to make people aware of guidelines. I have contributed to several other SE, so it's fair to say that I know SE  expectations and SE culture.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I run an ebook publishing company and I have written about the ebook industry for a while. I know a lot of things about ebook technology and standards. I format ebooks everyday and work as an editor in Katy, TX . I also am a writer and geek. I have gone out of my way to publicize the ebook SE on another websites and on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried my best to be helpful and polite, especially to newbies who may be unfamiliar with SE rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I see a lot of effort on this SE to remove posts and answers even when it is unwarranted. This has happened to me several times. Sometimes the judgment is questionable or based on an alleged infraction which is borderline or debateable. I am an advocate for loose enforcement of SE guidelines -- mainly because  strict enforcement of guidelines is usually unnecessary and alienates people. Also, I feel that way  because I understand that it takes time for newbies to learn the SE mores, and I want to be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, moderator Ed Cotrell deleted my answer  to explain to a new user about the right way to find an answer to his off-topic question. My answer was appropriate, polite and still helpful. HERE IS THE QUESTION WITH THE DELETED ANSWER: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/7448/i-need-recommendations/7450?noredirect=1#comment4854_7450&quot;&gt;I NEED RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why was it deleted? Because somehow my &quot;help&quot; was not appropriate or in the appropriate form. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call b.s. on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I answer ebook questions on this SE several times each week, sometimes even daily. According to Ed Cotrell's profile, he hasn't answered a single ebook question in almost  2 years on this SE. He mainly does moderation: deleting answers and voting to close things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, according to Ed Cotrell's bio data, he doesn't even work in the ebook field.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third,  my answer was helpful and polite. Cotrell's response was classic deletionism. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a technical reason I chose to post an answer below and not as a comment underneath the question. I needed more space, and the answer field allows that. Please note that I did make a comment to the question, as is customary on SE. Additionally, I posted a longer answer. That is beyond what is necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell is infuriating to me. It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners. It mis-applies a SE  rule. It is deeply hostile both to new users and frequent users. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I might have brought this up individually with Mr. Cotrell, but apparently he's keeping his email a secret and the SE application doesn't have the functionality of direct messaging. Posting something on META is  literally the only way that SE allows you to protest a moderator's action. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this were the only time this sort of thing  happened, I would let it pass. But this happens to me and others on a semi-regular basis on the Ebook SE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I have decided to permanently leave the Ebook SE. Please note that I will continue contributing to the Writers SE and some of the other SE. But I grow weary of this nonsense.

(A&#xA;big list is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/sites#lifearts&quot;&gt;https://stackexchange.com/sites#lifearts&lt;/a&gt;  See for&#xA;example the sci/fi -- fantasy SE. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Generally though, a lot of SE try to discourage people from asking&#xA;recommendation questions of the sort you are asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many other sites out there might have more open (and less constrictive&#xA;) discussion policies. For example, Reddit has many interesting&#xA;subreddits dedicated to special topics.

On the other hand,&#xA;these guidelines also allow the topics to stay focused on questions&#xA;that can be answered objectively. Hope this helps...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should point out three things before we go any further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question was off-topic and unsalvageable.&lt;/strong&gt; You even cast the first vote to close it for being off-topic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You made no attempt to answer the (off-topic) question&lt;/strong&gt; by recommending books. Your &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; was commentary about why the question was off-topic. Note: I'm not saying you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have offered recommendations. I'm saying your &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; wasn't an answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You posted your &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; on October 7.

I needed more space, and the answer field allows that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a reason comments are limited in length: we don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; extremely long how-to posts every time someone asks an off-topic question. The sites on the SE network get thousands of off-topic, nonsensical, incoherent, overly broad, or otherwise bad questions per day. We don't want users reposting the entire Help section in the answers (or the comments) to all of those questions. And in any case, &amp;quot;I needed more space&amp;quot; does not convert a series of comments into an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This deletion action by Mr. Cotrell [sic] is infuriating to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It attempts to make the ebook SE less helpful to readers and questioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope.

I get enough email without hundreds of complaints about who-knows-what (that likely didn't even involve me) flooding my inbox every day.

Because the content and meaning of the announcement is the same for both sites, I have not edited it to be specific to Ebooks. But, because it impacts both sites, I feel it is important for me to post it in both locations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Prologue&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, I resigned as a moderator on both Stack Overflow and Ebooks. I feel I owe this community some attempt at an explanation. Please understand that I cannot offer a full explanation of everything that led me to this decision. This is likely going to strike many people as vague, inadequate, and unsatisfying. For that I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware, there is an ongoing wave of moderator resignations and at least one firing across the Stack Exchange network, as summarized and collected in &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper&quot;&gt;this post on Meta SE&lt;/a&gt;. You may also have heard or read in the above post or posts linked therein that there are many frustrated moderators in the SE network right now. That much is true. There's no point rehashing all of it here. And I do not want to publish private or confidential information, so I will not be adding any details or disclosures about what has happened, is going on now, or may be happening in the future. The astute reader can likely figure out 95% of it, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;My Decision&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am resigning primarily due to the same events that led to many of the resignations in the above list. Recent events—many of which are not and will never be public, others of which are not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; public—have forced me to two conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sadly, I can no longer serve as a moderator on Stack Overflow or Ebooks in good conscience, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I no longer want to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set out on my moderator journey in January 2014, when I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/07/27/moderator-pro-tempore/&quot;&gt;asked to serve as a moderator &lt;em&gt;pro tempore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Ebooks after following it and participating in it as early as its Area 51 proposal. In November 2015, I was honored to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/election/7&quot;&gt;elected as a moderator&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow. Both times, I undertook the obligations, duties, responsibilities, and privileges of being a moderator because I loved and believed in the community in question, appreciated the robust rules and norms each had developed, and wanted to give back to communities that had helped me so much. When I stepped down on SO for several months due to major changes in my personal life and severe time constraints, I came back when my time freed up only because I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; believed in the community and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; wanted to help it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My resignation is the other side of that coin: I simply will not be able to serve these communities as a moderator in the future, and so I must resign. Many policies, facts, and events have played a role in this, but as I have said above, I cannot fully explain them here. I have wrestled with how to explain exactly what led to my decision to resign. I have concluded that I cannot offer much detail without leaving out even more and muddying the waters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; to address a common question in the answers and comments on Stack Overflow: Many have asked why I cannot explain my reasoning. The best answer I can give comes from two of my comments below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731801_390025&quot;&gt;Comment 1:&lt;/a&gt; Please understand that, just as I can’t explain all of my reasons for resigning, I can’t explain all of the reasons that is so. It may help you to understand that I am an attorney “in real life.” That creates a huge number of obligations to refrain from speaking about various situations or issues. Let me be extremely clear that I’m not (1) saying that legal issues had anything to do with my resignation, (2) accusing anyone of lying or anything else, or (3) stating any legal opinions on anything. I am saying that I, personally, cannot offer the kind of explanation people might want. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/389991/why-i-resigned-as-a-moderator#comment731869_390030&quot;&gt;Comment 2:&lt;/a&gt; All of us are subject to various limits on our conduct—legally, ethically, professionally, or otherwise—which I am willing to believe all of us take very seriously. Some of us are subject to more such constraints than others. If you look at the list of resignations in the MSE post that I linked to under background, you will see that several former moderators offer detailed explanations of their decisions. Nobody—as far as I know—is trying to hide anything that should be public, but that doesn’t mean we are at liberty to say whatever we want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What's Next&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What happens now? I'm not sure. I am weighing whether and to what extent it makes sense for me to continue to participate on SO, Ebooks, or other SE sites. I'm going to take a break from them for a bit, in any case. It's going to take a good, long while to wash out of my brain &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/354236/2057919&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/338297/2057919&quot;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; (images, rants, or otherwise) I've encountered as a moderator, and getting my brain out of &amp;quot;moderator mode&amp;quot; seems in order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been honored to serve this community.

I'm aware the legality of this may be debatable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Context: I've bought a paper book, but after more than 3 weeks I'm still waiting.  I need the book in preparation for a deadline that is coming up soon, so I intend to buy the ebook.  Sources for the ebook that I can find are in EPUB format with DRM from Adobe Digital Editions, which apparently does not work (well) on my Linux computer, which means I cannot (properly) read the ebook unless I remove DRM first.  There may be ways to do that, but would asking so be on-topic on this site?  I have read removing DRM may be illegal in some places, which might make it off-topic, but in my humble opinion my intended use case is entirely ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13892" LastEditorUserId="142" LastEditDate="2020-03-13T21:20:22.290" LastActivityDate="2020-03-13T21:20:22.290" Title="Are questions about removing DRM on-topic?"
